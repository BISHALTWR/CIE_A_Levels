<u><h1> Searching and Sorting</h1></u>

1) An array `WORDS` contains 100 strings. Write a program to sort the array using bubble sort based on following criteria:
    - Shorter strings should arrive first
    - Among strings with same length, sort alphabetically.

> Assume comparision operators works for string as well.

2) An array `NUMBERS` contains 200 numbers. Write a program to:
    - Calculate mean/average of the numbers
    - Check if the mean exists in the numbers array.
> Output format "Mean is 45 and it doesn't exist in the array."
