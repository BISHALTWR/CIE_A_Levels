1) Write a program that:
    - takes a number as input from user
    - Displays:
        - "The number is multiple of 7" if the number is muliple of 7
        - "The number is not multiple of 7" if it is not

2) Define a function multiples() that takes two parameters num, n as input and Displays first n multiples of num
    - Test the function by calling it as:
        - multiples(5,10) which should display first 10 multiples of 5
        - multiples(2,2) which should display first 2 multiples of 2

3) Write a program to display the following pattern

- if..elif..else
```py
if <condition>:
    # block of code
elif <condition>: # repeat this as many times as required
    # block of code
else:
    # block of code
```

- for_loop
```py
for i in range(n): # or range(start, stop, increment)
        # block of code

# The block of code is repreated n times
```

- function_definition
```py
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2,.... parameterN):
